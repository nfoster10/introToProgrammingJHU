problem: need a program that can calculate and dsipaly the opopulation for each of the next five years

user inputs: current population, birth rate, death rate, and immigration rate
output: futurePopulation

Assmptions:
A valid user input is a number
The generated futurePopulation data does not need to be stored elsewhere after it is displayed
Once the futurePopulation reaches 0, it cannot recover and the algorhthim can terminate
User inputs will not change once retrieved

//retrieve valid inputs
	//retrieve valid currentPopulation
	while valid user input currentPopulation data has not been received
		prompt user for currentPopulation in persons per seconds
		if user input for currentPopulation is still invalid
			output an error message

	//retrieve valid birthRate
	while valid user input birthRate data has not been received
		prompt user for brithRate in persons per seconds
		if user input for birthRate is still invalid
			output an error message

	//retrieve valid deathRate
	while valid user input deathRate data has not been received
		prompt user for deathRate in persons per seconds
		if user input for deathRate is still invalid
			output an error message

	//retrieve valid immigrationRate
	while valid user input immigrationRate data has not been received
		prompt user for immigrationRate in persons per seconds
		if user input for immigrationRate is still invalid
			output an error message

//calculate five year projections
	secondsPerYear = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60

	//calculate change rate in persons per year
	changeRate = (birthRate + immigrationRate - deathRate) * secondsPerYear

	//define futurePopulation for any variable yearsPassed
	futurePopulation = yearsPassed * changeRate + currentPopulation

//display data to user
	for the next five yearsPassed
		if the futurePopulaton for the current yearsPassed is greater than 0
			output futurePopulation to the user display
		otherwise
			output 0 to the user display
			if the yearsPassed is less than five
				output a warning message
			terminate processing
